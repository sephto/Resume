I'm currently a student at FIU working on my bachelors degree in Information Technology with an emphasize on Software. 
My curriculum expands from MySQL to Linux Bash scripting and Windows Shell all the way to writing and ethics. 

On the side I enjoy programming video games and simple application to keep my programming skills sharp.
These are a few examples of what I have done so far.
